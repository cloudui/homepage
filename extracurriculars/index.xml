In 2022, the topic of interest was environmental sustainability. Per Northrop Grumman&amp;rsquo;s own description, the point of the game was to &amp;ldquo;develop an original concept for a product, service, software, or a combination of the three, in areas such as clean energy, water scarcity, food security&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
A joint team of three others and I designed an IoT stormwater management system to prevent runoff and flooding on residential properties.</description></item><item><title>SEDS - Liquid Rocket Team</title><link>http://echen.io/extracurriculars/seds/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 16:40:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/extracurriculars/seds/</guid><description>I lead the Data Acquisition Team subteam in UMD SEDS&amp;rsquo;s Liquid Rocket Team. Our responsibility is to manage the testing instrumentation, data collection, and safety protocols of the team. The liquid rocket team is the newest addition to SEDS@UMD, launched in 2021. Liquid rocket engines are notoriously difficult to manufacture, as liquid fuel propulsion requires a considerable more amount of calculation and engineering decisions than your traditional solid-fuel rocket engines. Despite the hardships, we aim to hot-fire test our first 350lbf rocket engine during the 2022-2023 year and launch an actual rocket sometime within the next 5 years.</description></item><item><title>Terps Racing</title><link>http://echen.io/extracurriculars/terps-racing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Jun 2022 13:41:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/extracurriculars/terps-racing/</guid><description>A team that builds small-scale formula racing cars for competition? Count me in. I was a member of the composites subteam, a team full of all mechanical engineers, one materials scientist, a computer engineer (me), and a former mechanical engineering turned computer science student.
The Story I helped build the carbon fiber monocoque for our 2023 formula car. Why not this years, you might ask. That&amp;rsquo;s a great question. There are two reasons:</description></item></channel></rss>
