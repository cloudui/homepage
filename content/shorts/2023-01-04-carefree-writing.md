I have not published a blog post in half a year. Emphasis on *published*. I have many backlogged drafts that I never completed, from book reviews to self reflections. Writing has become a chore for me. I spend too much time on the details, losing focus on the greater meaning behind the piece itself. If writing is thinking, then I have not thought. If writing is self expression, then I have not expressed myself. As I have been told, don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

The medium really matters. I expect my blogs to be long and drawn out, even though they do not need to be. People write very short and simple blogs all of the time. When I tweet some shower thought on Twitter, I am never bogged down by expectation. I wish to carry that mindset over to my normal writing.

Inspired by my friend, [Eli Qian](https://eliqian.xyz/publish), I am making a commitment to writing more often. I will try to publish more short-form writing to make it easier to get back into writing. For the next month, I will post an excerpt here daily. I will not worry about word counts or public judgement. I am letting my spirit roam free.
