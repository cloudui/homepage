I watched the sun rise at Dania Beach, Florida this morning. I watched as the rays of our red-orange Sun peeked over the dark blue horizon. As it rose across the waters, the light reflected off of the ocean, forming a gold carpet towards the shore. The sky was smeared salmon and pink, gradually melting into blue. It was awe-inspiringly beautiful. 

This wasn't my first sunrise. As a matter of fact, the Sun has rose every single day that I have been alive. I've seen it with my own eyes a dozen times, and each time has been more beautiful than the last. How can we find such joy in something so trivial? A simple answer is that the sky turns pretty colors. That is also a good answer. Watching a sunrise is usually a special event because we don't witness it every day, and the fact that it is beautiful is a good enough reason to enjoy it. But, I feel like it's more than that. There's emotion, too. The lingering feeling of awe, humility, appreciation, and calm. For the rest of our lives, the Sun will rise happily every day. It doesn't care about the state of politics or the recent wildfire. It doesn't care that you got a promotion or that your loved one just passed. Nature will run its course. Even when you're gone, it will continue to do its job for an eternity. It makes us see how trivial we are on our space rock. No matter your problems, no matter your strife, the Sun will start a new day.
