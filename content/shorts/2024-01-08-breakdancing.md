Near the end of my freshman year of college, I attended my close friend Alex's end-of-year dance performance at the University of Pennsylvania. He had auditioned for Penn's exclusive Pan-Asian Dance Troupe as a complete beginner and was accepted as a new member. I began to see how dance seeped into his identity over the school year. I saw a more confident version of him as he became enveloped into a new dance world.
