Everyone complains about the nature of our political system, and for good reason, too. It's easy to see all the wrong within our political system. We've all witnessed the idiotic politicians on TV, ridiculous political battles headlining in the news, and the unusually frequent scandals that pop up on our feed. We hear of ridiculous new policies, watch unncessary interpersonal beef on Twitter, and experience the stagnation and doldrums of bureaucracy. It would be weird to not be critical of imperfection. 

Even though we all hate the political system in one way or another, I can't help but think that we are all responsible for how it turned out. Not because of anything wrong with us, but rather because we are human. We are wired in a way where on a population scale, we behave in unbelievably predictable ways. In some way or another, our political system was always going to turn out this way. In this piece, I wanted to discuss how the human element permeates into politics and how the "bad" things within our systems are simply human.
