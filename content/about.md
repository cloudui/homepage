Now that you know a bit of background about me, I'll share some career interests with you too. If you want to learn more about the type of person I am, take a look at [my blog](https://echen.io).


# Career Interests

My entire CS path so far has been cloud centric. It all started when I wanted to share Twitter Bot I made that would respond to my friends' tweets. I had to figure out how to deploy it. After consulation with some experts (my dad), I was advised to put my code on a Lambda function on some <i class="fa fa-cloud"></i>. Ever since, I have gone down rabbit holes about the latest and greatest cloud offerings, obtaining a certification in AWS and studying up on technologies such as Kubernetes and Docker. I'm also hoping to become GCP ACE certified by the end of this summer.

Most of my coding experience is from web development and a bit of machine learning. My first big project was [Pulsar Academy](/projects/pulsaracademy), where I made a website to host coding classes I was going to teach. I was able to experience the full-stack development experience, pulling late night grinds to create user registration, payment integration, and content hosting. Every time I work on a website, I have an undying motivation to fulfill my creative desires, hoping to present something concrete that I can share to the world. 

I'm taking steps to enter the machine learning world, but I still primarily remain a beginner. I've been gobsmacked by creations such as DALLÂ·E 2, AlphaZero, and Google Image Search. It's unbelievable how creative and limitless the machine learning researchers are, and I hope to join the mix eventually, assuming it is the right choice for me. I'm also very much interested in the electrical and computer engineering world, but I am less aware of what's going on out there. That's what I'll be exploring in my university years.

Some other things I'm want to investigate:
- Blockchain and Web3
- Quantative Finance
- Robotics and Perception
- CPU + GPU architecture and design

## Peeking Over the Walled Garden[^1]
You might have noticed the underlying presupposition of my career choices. I'm making a pretty big gamble that I will pursue careers related to my major. That only makes sense, right? There are a lot of great things in the CE industry and lots of great choices. But even today, But there's a whole other world out there, and I shouldn't simply box myself into one domain of expertise. 

I like a lot of other things too, perhaps even more than computer science or engineering. I'm making a devotion to at least consider over the next few years:
- Psychology and Cognitive Science
- Physics & Astronomy
- Teaching 
- Earth Science
- Business & Finance
- Politics & Culture
- History 
- Economics & Hierarchies

Life is too short for me to be committed to one perspective. The only way I'll figure out what I want is to gamble a bit with my life.
