Being thrust into the world of engineering was a thrilling experience. When you're tasked with building an autonomous data-collecting vehicle that traverses a makeshift terrestrial arena, how could it not be? 

Thank you to my team: Ruth, Alex, Emmanuel, Michael, Curtis, Ajeet, Yaqi. I had a blast.
