Initiated an online business to educate the youth about coding principles and fundamentals. Programmed and designed a website with Django and JavaScript to manage registration, payment, and course content. Containerized website with PostgreSQL database and SSL daemon using Docker compose. Hosted website using AWS EC2 and RDS using a NGINX webserver.

## The story

The first large-scale coding project I ever did. It was the big finale of all the small projects I had started a few months before. Although I had taken Java classes in school before, I was blissfully unaware of what actually went on in the tech world. From an itching to do something big during COVID, my friend Maxwell and I decided to start a small online business to teach coding to beginners. He would teach C++ and competitive programming, and I would teach Python, Java, and Web Development.

How were we going to manage our registration and content? We could have easily went with a simple Google Forms - Google Sheets signup process, hosting all the content in a Google Drive for our students to use. Would've been fast and effective enough. But, it wasn't personable. It didn't radiate enthusiasm, class, or quality. Why would someone sign up for classes with little effort, mostly when the instructors were only in high school? Fortunately, through reading random books and following guides on YouTube, I learned how to make websites with Django. I was also studying this "revolutionary cloud platform" that my dad told me about, and I finally started to be able to use the black voodoo terminal in my start menu. What a great opportunity to put my skills into use!

I spent around a month making the website ready for use. I did my development using Django and PostgreSQL, containerized with docker and orchestrated with `docker-compose`. A gruelling but fulfilling project. I stayed up late every night, just trying to squeeze in a couple more hours of work. It was fun, having a website materialize in front of me. It was my own design. Some things I learned how do: 

- Registration and signup
- Payment integration with API requests
- Authentication to access certain pages

By the end, we had a functioning website with all of the bells and whistles. 
However, this was only one part of the story. Honestly, it might have been the easiest part. How were we going to get people to register? Nobody knew who we were. My high school friends were not in our target demographic. At last, the question of advertising and recruiting surfaced.
