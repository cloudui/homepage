## Don't let good opportunities slip away

The story of how I became involved with this competition is a funny one. It was a month and a half into my second semester of university. Due to the heavy workload from my new clubs, I was coming home around 9:00-10:00 pm four times a week. My priorities were in a jumble, and my mind was a constantly swimming with items on my todo list. Then, I realized that I was sooaring on Cloud 9 in the first semester. Despite my struggles, I was proud of my mental fortitude, and trivial complications were not going to sway me. 

Unfortunately, this confidence would generally slip away before bedtime. As I lay awake in bed staring at the blank ceiling, my stress went through the roof as I mentally prepared for the next day of challenges, meetings, and obstacles. One day, my phone buzzed in my pocket as I was doing work in my room. I opened the notification from my club slack, I read a recruiting message from Sophie, a person on my team I had never met before. It was something along the lines of:
- I'm participating in the NG Environmental Sustainability Challenge
- I have an idea and a contact, and it's promising
- I need 3-4 teammates willing to work with me and put in effort

I was aware of the competition but had no intentions on participating. But, one sentence stood out to me: *I have an idea and a contact*. Those aren't words you generally hear before a competition has even started. Since I was already drowning in my own workload and was not even acquainted with the message poster, I ignored it. But those words echoed around my head for a week. *She already had an idea for an innovation-based competition?* I would think. *Could I just let an opportunity this juicy slip through my fingers?*

I consulted my friends about it. All of them told me that it was a stupid idea. They were probably right, too, as I was still stumbling through my other work. One night, I expressed my interest with my roommate right before bed. He advised me not to do it. I agreed with his assessment. But before I went to sleep, I messaged Sophie: "I'm interested in helping you out. Let me know when we can meet." I put my phone down for the night, and the rest is history[^1].
