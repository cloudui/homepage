Everything that we experience is through the lens through which we view the world, influenced by the major and minute variables of our environment. I have come to a point in my life where I can notice how my past affects the way I behave. I see the ways my upbringing shaped my personality and my desires, in both relationships and company. We make these sorts of observations about others very often.</description></item><item><title>Help or Harm?</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/help-or-harm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/help-or-harm/</guid><description>With the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, people have begun to discuss whether they are more beneficial or detrimental to society. On the one hand, they are accentuating what is possible. On the other, they are replacing tasks that humans would traditionally do. But, why is that a bad thing, if even a bad thing at all? Automating human activities can have the consequence of replacing humans completely. The invention of the telephone switchboard in the early 1900s ended up replacing hundreds of thousands of telephone operators.</description></item><item><title>You Might've Been a Nazi</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/you-mightve-been-a-nazi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/you-mightve-been-a-nazi/</guid><description>We live in the fairest time in human history. The people today are the most wealthy and free compared to almost everyone even a few hundred years ago. I never said we live in a perfect society. Poverty, racism, and inequality still plague our planet today. But, we can be thankful for all of the incredible developments we have made in recent history.
Let&amp;rsquo;s travel back in time for a second.</description></item><item><title>Time is Relative</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/time-is-relative/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/time-is-relative/</guid><description>Occam&amp;rsquo;s Razor tells us that the simplest idea is always the best. In many situations, this is true. There is no need to needlessly complicate. The more complications you create, the more explanations you need to find.
This rule does not apply in the realm of time. We perceive time to move in a linear fashion, but this is not the case at all. Einstein discovered almost 100 years ago that in every situation, time is relative.</description></item><item><title>Bicker Bicker</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/bicker-bicker/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/bicker-bicker/</guid><description>The truth is the light in the darkness. When you are uncertain, the truth is the absolute defense. It gives us solid ground to stand on. We all strive for truth. It allows us to understand the reality we live in. We learn to find the truth. We think, we observe, and we grow&amp;ndash; all with the purpose of getting closer to the absolute truth. And lastly, we argue for it.</description></item><item><title>Who are You?</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/who-are-you/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/who-are-you/</guid><description>Who are you? A collection of cells that form a mass of muscle, tissue, and bones around 5-7 feet high. A vessel of consciousness existing within the framework of time and space. An amalgamation of memories, character traits, and emotion. You probably have a strong sense of who you are. You are the primary witness of your body, your memories, your thought processes, and your consciousness. Everyone else is just a mere observer.</description></item><item><title>Hero or Villain?</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/hero-or-villain/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/hero-or-villain/</guid><description>Today is Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It&amp;rsquo;s a day to celebrate one of the most important leaders of the Civil Rights movement. A day to honor the man who delivered one of the most memorable and impactful speeches in American history. A day to honor the man who dreamt of a world where people would be evaluated by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin.</description></item><item><title>Death</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/death/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/death/</guid><description>Death awaits all of us. He is calm and patient. Some will arrive at his doorstep early. Some will take many years. But, at time&amp;rsquo;s end, he will greet all of us at his door. There is no escape.
Death is such a grave concept (pun intended). It marks the point where something ceases to live. Everyone lives to avoid death. We eat to not starve. We exercise to stay healthy.</description></item><item><title>In Defense of Difficult Exams</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/difficult-exams/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/difficult-exams/</guid><description>Nobody likes difficult exams. After all, the professor might ask us questions we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen before. He might ask about ideas we haven&amp;rsquo;t considered before. Difficult exams can tank my grade. That wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be fair, right? Unfortunately, I would argue that those are actually &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; things.
What is the purpose of an exam? Exams are meant to test your understanding of the material. I&amp;rsquo;ve had many exams in college that are just refreshed versions of previous semesters&amp;rsquo; exams.</description></item><item><title>Shared Identity</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/shared-identity/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/shared-identity/</guid><description>I went on a boat tour in Everglades National Park this afternoon. Our tour guide, Mitchell, took guided us through the 3-mile-long Buttonwood Canal, where we arrived at the mouth of Florida Bay. He was very knowledgeable of the different plants, birds, and animal life in the area– after all, it’s his job. Along the water, we passed by a few speedboats driven by middle-aged men with short hair, sun hats, sunglasses, fishing rods, and tanned skin.</description></item><item><title>Sunrise</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/sunrise/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/sunrise/</guid><description>I watched the sun rise at Dania Beach, Florida this morning. I watched as the rays of our red-orange Sun peeked over the dark blue horizon. As it rose across the waters, the light reflected off of the ocean, forming a gold carpet towards the shore. The sky was smeared salmon and pink, gradually melting into blue. It was awe-inspiringly beautiful.
This wasn&amp;rsquo;t my first sunrise. As a matter of fact, the Sun has rose every single day that I have been alive.</description></item><item><title>Dealt an Unfortunate Hand</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/unfortunate-hand/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/unfortunate-hand/</guid><description>Life is unfair. Some people start with everything and some people start with nothing. We&amp;rsquo;re born of circumstances that we cannot control. We do not decide our parents, our birthplace, our birthday, or our name. We&amp;rsquo;re given a hand, and we&amp;rsquo;re forced to play it. It&amp;rsquo;s an undeniable fact that people have different privileges. Some people are beautiful, some people are geniuses, some people are tall, and some people have it all.</description></item><item><title>Chess Addiction</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/chess-addiction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/chess-addiction/</guid><description>Over the last two years, I have become addicted to chess. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent hours upon hours watching analyses of famous games between the strongest grandmasters that have ever lived. Each game is a story. Some are long, others are short. Some are super complicated, others are relatively simple. Some are wild, others are calm. The variety keeps the game interesting, just as different books and genres keep reading interesting. The style of a game depends on the player, the time format, the mood, the environment, and more.</description></item><item><title>Humans are Silly</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/humans-are-silly/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/humans-are-silly/</guid><description>Humans are silly. We do a lot of really silly things. We look at squiggles on a piece of paper to learn. We bop our heads to random assembleges of acoustic waves. We go to office buildings and trade our time for pieces of paper with fancy images on them. The list goes on and on. We&amp;rsquo;ve all heard that nagging voice from a parent or friend: &amp;ldquo;why are you wasting your time?</description></item><item><title>Dating Apps</title><link>http://echen.io/shorts/dating-apps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://echen.io/shorts/dating-apps/</guid><description>I was going to write about dating apps here, but it ended up being so long that I put it on my blog.

Emphasis on published. I have many backlogged drafts that I never completed, from book reviews to self reflections. Writing has become a chore for me. I spend too much time on the details, losing focus on the greater meaning behind the piece itself. If writing is thinking, then I have not thought. If writing is self expression, then I have not expressed myself.</description></item></channel></rss>
