I am a software developer on the tech team.
Accomplishments So Far Built Registration App with Vue.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB Form logic + design Built website with Vue.js Working on the EXPO app This is a story version. I will have an update with more technical details soon.</description></item><item><title>ENES100: An Engineering Interlude</title><link>https://echen.io/projects/enes100/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Jul 2022 13:41:48 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://echen.io/projects/enes100/</guid><description>Being thrust into the world of engineering was a thrilling experience. When you&amp;rsquo;re tasked with building an autonomous data-collecting vehicle that traverses a makeshift terrestrial arena, how could it not be?
Thank you to my team: Ruth, Alex, Emmanuel, Michael, Curtis, Ajeet, Yaqi. I had a blast.

It was the big finale of all the small projects I had started a few months before. Although I had taken Java classes in school before, I was blissfully unaware of what actually went on in the tech world.
