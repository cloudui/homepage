The organization had to revert to a manual and error-prone method of registering and checking in employers and student organizations after the servers that hosted their digital registration and check-in portal for career fairs were shut down. The new process made it difficult for ECS to properly track organizers and student volunteering hours, which made it challenging to compensate them adequately.</description></item></channel></rss>
