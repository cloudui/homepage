    content: |-
      **Welcome!** I'm Eric, and I'm a sophomore studying Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland. I have a small presence online via my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/below_ocean), my [short-form writing](/shorts) and my [blog](https://blog.echen.io), where I share advice and my inner musings. The topics I write about include:
      - Technology and the Internet
      - Cognitive Science and Pyschology
      - Areas of Science
      - Culture and Politics
      - Cloud Computing
      - Popular media

      If you want to learn about what kind of person I am, those are the best places to look. I also want to learn more about you, too!
      Find me in my socials below.

  # A grand and warm welcome to you. Allow me to introduce myself.
  # I am a Computer Engineering and Robotics student at the University of Maryland. If I could only tell you one interesting fact about me, I would tell you that I can solve a
  # Rubik's cube in less than 10 seconds. If we had more time, I would share my love for basketball, breakdancing, reading, Frank Sinatra, blogging, and the violin. If I could describe
  # myself in one word, I would say that I am a learner, one who desires to understand the world.

  # I was put on this planet with purpose and resolve, and I aim to exploit it. The allure to settle down is strong, but the allure to
  # improve and achieve is even stronger. Most people will follow the main stream, but I will take the distributary (geology jokes).
  # If life has a meaning, I want to find it.

  # I want to learn about you, too! Find me in my socials below!

          I worked within the Data Science Division - MLOps Team at Mailchimp/Intuit. I experimented with methods to optimize the deployment of data science models to production. 

          I audited three of the datascience pipelines and proposed a myriad of problems and solutions relating to documentation, testing, versioning, notebook development, and production readiness.
          I was responsible for automating Python and SQL documentation generation and version control. I 
          integrated the solutions into our new repository templates.

          Some of the cool technologies I'm worked with and learned:
          - Kubernetes and Docker
          - Jenkins and Airflow
          - Python Library Template Engines
          - Google Cloud Platform

          I am a part of the QUEST (Quality Enhancement Systems & Teams) Honors Program in Cohort 40. QUEST is an interdisciplinary program for 
          business, engineering, and science students to gain hands-on experience within the industry by partnering with large corporations. 
          We learn how to communicate with clients, create solutions to real problems, and work within intellectually diverse teams.

          Our curriculum consists of the following:
          - BMGT 190H: Introduction to Quality and Design
          - BMGT 438A: Applied Quantitative Analysis
          - BMGT 390H: Designing Innovative Systems
          - BMGT 490H: A Capstone project where students consult QUEST's coporate partners on an identified organizational challenge

          I conducted a research project at what would be my future alma mater in my junior year of high school. Having exprimented with Twitter's Developer API before my internship, 
          I was inspired to do machine learning research on public sentiment on the social media platform. I worked under Dr. Daniel Lathrop and Dr. Heidi Komkov of the Nonlinear Dynamics Laboratory.
          - Designed an Artificial Neural Network with Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow to predict the exposure of tweets using sentiment analysis. 
          - Created a custom data pipeline using Python and the Twitter Application Programming Interface. 
          - Collaborated with mentors to determine and optimize hyperparameters for making predictive estimations of exposure.
          - Presented research to laboratory and peers.

          I and four other collaborators studied the effects of gene expression during embryogenis on cancer metastasis. We queried the E14.5 mouse embryo database using CBioPortal, one of the
          leading online hosts of cancer research data.
          - Queried and identified a dozen critical cancer-related genes in the central nervous system of the E14.5 mouse embryo
          - Performed statistical analysis and analyzed Kaplan-Meier Curves for each gene using cBioPortal genomic datasets

          Our abstract was accepted by the AACR, and we were invited to present at their annual conference in 2020. Unfortunately, due to the COVID pandemic, we were not able to present.
