    content: 
      casual: 
        A grand and warm welcome to you, my friend. Allow me to introduce myself. 
        I am a Computer Engineering and Robotics student at the University of Maryland. If I could only tell you one interesting fact about me, I would tell you that I can solve a 
        Rubik's cube in less than 10 seconds. If we had more time, I would share my love for basketball, weightlifting, reading, Frank Sinatra, writing & blogging, and the violin. If I could describe 
        myself in one word, I would say I am a learner, one who desires to uniquely perceive the world. I strive to live a life with few regrets in the comforting embrace of interminable relationships.

        Now, you look like an interesting lad as well, probably more interesting than me. I want to learn about you! Find me in my socials at the bottom of the page, and let's chat!
      professional:
        I am a cloud-native computing enthusiast. I love tinkering with the breadth of services offered by AWS and GCP. So much so that I obtained an AWS Solutions Architect Certification and am looking to take the GCP ACE exam this summer.
        I spend a lot of time thinking about automation, networking, and pipelines. I'm always looking for more cool tools to experiment with. 
        
        I love making websites, writing funny bots on Twitter, and exploring the latest tech gadgets. I am taking steps to enter the novel machine learning world, but I 
        still am in the early learning stages. I am also hoping to explore blockchains and quantatative trading. In university, I am aiming to peer into the world of robotics and hardware design.

        I am always looking to gather more resources. If you consider yourself an expert in anything, please reach out and send me your most recommended texts or videos. I would love to take a look!

          We teach public forum debate to middle school students around the country. 
          I have coached students on how to plan debate strategies, organize evidence, think critically, and speak with authority. 
          I handled Trailblazer's sign-up, administrative organization, advertising, and financial system. 
          Our team has successfully hosted 6 debate camp sessions so far!

          I conducted a research project at what would be my future alma mater in my junior year of high school. Having exprimented with Twitter's Developer API before my internship, 
          I was inspired to do machine learning research on public sentiment on the social media platform. I worked under Dr. Heidi Komkov of the Nonlinear Dynamics Laboratory.
          - Designed an Artificial Neural Network with Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow to predict the exposure of tweets using sentiment analysis. 
          - Created a custom data pipeline using Python and the Twitter Application Programming Interface. 
          - Collaborated with mentors to determine and optimize hyperparameters for making predictive estimations of exposure.
          - Presented research to laboratory and peers.

        content: |
          I and four other collaborators studied the effects of gene expression during embryogenis on cancer metastasis. We queried the E14.5 mouse embryo database using CBioPortal, one of the
          leading online hosts of cancer research data.
          - Queried and identified a dozen critical cancer-related genes in the central nervous system of the E14.5 mouse embryo
          - Performed statistical analysis and analyzed Kaplan-Meier Curves for each gene using cBioPortal genomic datasets
          
          Our abstract was accepted by the AACR, and we were invited to present at their annual conference in 2020. Unfortunately, due to the COIVD pandemic, we were not able to present.
