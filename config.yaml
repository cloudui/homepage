    content: |-
        A grand and warm welcome to you, my friend. Allow me to introduce myself. 
        I am a Computer Engineering and Robotics student at the University of Maryland. If I could only tell you one interesting fact about me, I would tell you that I can solve a 
        Rubik's cube in less than 10 seconds. If we had more time, I would share my love for basketball, weightlifting, reading, Frank Sinatra, writing & blogging, and the violin. If I could describe 
        myself in one word, I would say I am a learner, one who desires to uniquely perceive the world. I strive to live a life with few regrets in the comforting embrace of interminable relationships.

        Now, you look like an interesting lad as well-- one that is probably more interesting than me. I want to learn about you! Find me in my socials at the bottom of the page, and let's chat.

          I conducted a research project at what would be my future alma mater in my junior year of high school. Having exprimented with Twitter's Developer API before my internship, 
          I was inspired to do machine learning research on public sentiment on the social media platform. I worked under Dr. Heidi Komkov of the Nonlinear Dynamics Laboratory.
          - Designed an Artificial Neural Network with Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow to predict the exposure of tweets using sentiment analysis. 
          - Created a custom data pipeline using Python and the Twitter Application Programming Interface. 
          - Collaborated with mentors to determine and optimize hyperparameters for making predictive estimations of exposure.
          - Presented research to laboratory and peers.

          I and four other collaborators studied the effects of gene expression during embryogenis on cancer metastasis. We queried the E14.5 mouse embryo database using CBioPortal, one of the
          leading online hosts of cancer research data.
          - Queried and identified a dozen critical cancer-related genes in the central nervous system of the E14.5 mouse embryo
          - Performed statistical analysis and analyzed Kaplan-Meier Curves for each gene using cBioPortal genomic datasets
          
          Our abstract was accepted by the AACR, and we were invited to present at their annual conference in 2020. Unfortunately, due to the COIVD pandemic, we were not able to present.
