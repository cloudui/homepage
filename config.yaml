      **Welcome!** I'm Eric, and I'm a rising senior studying Computer Engineering at the University of Maryland. I have a small presence online via my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/below_ocean), my [short-form writing](/shorts), and my [blog](https://blog.echen.io), where I share advice and my inner musings. The topics I write about include:
      - Technology and the Internet
      - Cognitive Science and Pyschology
      - Areas of Science
      - Culture and Politics
      - Cloud Computing
      - Popular media

      My hobbies include playing basketball, writing, breakdancing, chess, watching K-dramas and anime, learning, and solving twisty puzzles. 

      I am interested in you, too! Find me in my socials below.

    # Career-wise, I specialize in deep learning, full-stack development, DevOps, cloud computing (AWS, GCP), product design, and consulting. I will be working extensively 
    # with robotics, microprocessor design, and FPGA design in the future.

          This summer, I worked at Mobius Labs, a very early-stage startup based in Menlo Park, California. Mobius is leveraging tools that 
          allow corporations to integrate generative AI into their business processes. I worked on fine-tuning generative AI models such as 
          text-to-image models and open source LLMs. 

          I was also responsible for staying up to date on the latest technologies in the AI space that could be valuable to the company's products. I experimented with
          emerging AI technologies such as LLM plugins and tools. 

          Stuff I'm worked on:
          - Building data analytics tools with LLMs
          - Testing viability of LLM tools to become potential products
          - Deploying models on AWS to run open source LLMs (text-generation-webui, Sagemaker, custom AMIs on EC2)
          - LangChain, Q&A chatbots, and agents
          - Building chat interfaces with Docker, React, and FastAPI
          - Constructing demos for potential enterprise customers using Streamlit
          - Getting product demos ready for enterprise contracts and VC funding

        # Why did I choose a startup? 
        # - I feel like I will be able to contribute to more crucial aspects of a company and hence, make more of a difference.
        # - I'm looking for the excitement of working for a Silicon Valley startup with driven and motivated founders. 
        # - I am particularly interested in exploring generative AI, which I likely wouldn't be able to at an established company.
        # - I will likely be able to contribute to multiple aspects of the company instead of one strict regimen.
        # - I can see what goes into a business model, how a startup adapts, and how how a small company is run.

          I worked within the Data Science Division - MLOps Team at Mailchimp/Intuit. I experimented with methods to optimize the deployment of data science models to production. 

          I audited three of the datascience pipelines and proposed a myriad of problems and solutions relating to documentation, testing, versioning, notebook development, and production readiness.
          I was responsible for automating Python and SQL documentation generation and version control. I 
          integrated the solutions into our new repository templates.

          Some of the cool technologies I'm worked with and learned:

          I am a part of the QUEST (Quality Enhancement Systems & Teams) Honors Program in Cohort 40. QUEST is an interdisciplinary program for 
          business, engineering, and science students to gain hands-on experience within the industry by partnering with large corporations. 
          We learn how to communicate with clients, create solutions to real problems, and work within intellectually diverse teams.

          For the first course, my team and I designed Verbalinkd, a platform to connect immigrant restaurant owners connect with service professionals that
          they can communicate with. A large portion of immigrant entrepreneurs struggle with language barriers on a daily basis, and we aimed to alleviate
          them. Read more about that [here!](/projects/verbalinkd/)
          
          My group consulted for the University of Maryland's Engineering Career Services, where we designed potential solutions
          to help alleviate issues relating to registration and check-in for employers at our school's career fairs. Read a detailed report about our 
          story [here!](/projects/engineering-career-services)

           Our curriculum consists of the following:
          - BMGT 190H: Introduction to Quality and Design
          - BMGT 438A: Applied Quantitative Analysis
          - BMGT 390H: Designing Innovative Systems

          - Designed an Artificial Neural Network with Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow to predict the exposure of tweets using sentiment analysis. 
          - Created a custom data pipeline using Python and the Twitter Application Programming Interface. 
          - Collaborated with mentors to determine and optimize hyperparameters for making predictive estimations of exposure.

          leading online hosts of cancer research data.
          - Queried and identified a dozen critical cancer-related genes in the central nervous system of the E14.5 mouse embryo
          - Performed statistical analysis and analyzed Kaplan-Meier Curves for each gene using cBioPortal genomic datasets

          Our abstract was accepted by the AACR, and we were invited to present at their annual conference in 2020. Unfortunately, due to the COVID pandemic, we were not able to present.
